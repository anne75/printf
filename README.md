## _printf

This is a printf function with the functionalities of printing characters (c), strings (s), % (%), octals(o), hexidecimals (x and X). We also have a custom formatter binary (b).

# Description of the files
. print.c
This is our file that contains our printf function. Also included is an error function that can return an error when called upon.
Formatter files

We created a file for each formatter. In each file, it should contain a make_formatter function that creates a string to fill in the buffer. Also included in each formatter file is a conversion check to see if we need to account for precision, width, or flag. If necessary, we also included a helper function to convert a number to a string.
Formatter files:  
. binary.c  
. chars.c  
. decimal.c  
. hex.c  
. heX.c  
. octal.c  
. strings.c  
. unsigned.c  
. percent.c  
. bigS.c  

Helper files
We created helper files to put universal helper functions such at idigit, no_conversion, reverse_array. These functions are used multiple times throughout the files.
Helper files:
. unihelper.c
is_digit
no_conversion
strlen
isdflag
. unihelper2.c
give_precision.c
give_width.c
get_result.c
. unihelper3.c
. numberhelper.c

# Example:
```
int main(void)
{
_printf("This is a char: [%c]\n", 'c')
_printf("This is a %s\n", "string.");
_printf("Unsigned octal:[%o]\n", ui);
_printf("Unsigned hexadecimal:[%x, %X]\n", ui, ui);
_printf("Unsigned:[%u]\n", ui);
_printf("Binary is [%b]\n", 98);
return (0)
}
```
Returns
```
This is a char: [c]
This is a string.
Unsigned octal:[20000001777]
Unsigned hexadecimal:[800003ff, 800003FF]
Unsigned:[2147484671]
Binary is [1100010]
